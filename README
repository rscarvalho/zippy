The goal of this project is to simplify the usage of the zipfile standard python module.

In other words, you should be able to do things like these:

>>> # Extract a zip file
>>> import zippy
>>> zippy.unzip("path/to/zipfile.zip", output_dir="/path/to/out", keep_structure=True)

>>> # Create a zip file
>>> import zippy
>>> zippy.zip_dir("path/to/directory", "path/to/file.zip", chdir=True)


This is just a draft. No work has been done yet.
